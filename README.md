# Hydrogen bonds aggregate

From the CSV files describing amino acid contacts between a Region of Interest and other regions of a protein during 
the Molecular Dynamics simulation, the script generates a plot of boxplots representing these contacts by domain and 
condition, along with a file containing the results of the statistical tests.

The input CSV data are produced by the [plot_hbonds](https://github.com/njeanne/plot_hbonds/tree/main) script.

## Conda environment

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) YAML environment file is provided: 
`conda_env/contacts_aggregate_env.yml`. The file contains all the dependencies to run the script.
The conda environment is generated using the command:
```shell script
# create the environment
conda env create -f conda_env/contacts_aggregate_env.yml

# activate the environment
conda activate contacts_aggregate
```

## Usage

The script can be tested with the test data provided in the `data` directory, which contains a CSV file describing the 
different conditions and the location of the directory containing the CSV output files from the [plot_contacts.py](https://github.com/njeanne/plot_contacts) 
script.

The input CSV file must be a comma separated file with a header as in the following example:

| condition    | path | boxplot color | dot color |
|--------------|---|---|---|
| insertions   | data/plot_hbonds_outputs/insertions | #fc030b | #700101 |
| duplications | data/plot_hbonds_outputs/duplications | #eb8c34 | #704001 |
| WT           | data/plot_hbonds_outputs/WT | #0303fc | #017070 |

Some optional arguments can be used:
- `--domain`: which is the path to a CSV file describing the domains of a protein. The order of the domains will be used to order the boxplots in the plot.
- `--group`: to group some conditions of the input CSV file.

The command to use the 3 conditions of the input CSV file is:
```shell script
conda activate contacts_aggregate

./hbonds_aggregate.py --md-time 1002 --domain data/sample_domains.csv \
--subtitle "3 classes" --out results data/conditions.csv

conda deactivate
```

The command to group *insertions* and *duplications* is:
```shell script
conda activate contacts_aggregate

./hbonds_aggregate.py --group insertions duplications --md-time 1002 --domain data/sample_domains.csv \
--subtitle "Grouped insertions and duplications" --out results data/conditions.csv

conda deactivate
```

## Outputs

The script outputs are:
- boxplots of the contacts by conditions and domains. Mann-Whitney tests with **two-sided as the null hypothesis** are performed for each domain between each pair of conditions.
Only the significant p-values are annotated:
```shell
p-value annotation legend:
      ns: 5.00e-02 < p <= 1.00e+00
       *: 1.00e-02 < p <= 5.00e-02
      **: 1.00e-03 < p <= 1.00e-02
     ***: 1.00e-04 < p <= 1.00e-03
    ****: p <= 1.00e-04
```

For the command using the 3 conditions separately:

For the command grouping *insertions* and *duplications*:
![contacts heatmap](doc/_static/boxplots_2-classes.svg)

- a CSV file of the Mann-Whitney test results with **group 1 greater than group 2 as the null hypothesis**, i.e. with the conditions *insertions* and *duplications* grouped:

## Vigilance on outputs

The statistical results may vary between the boxplots significance p-values and the CSV p-values
because the null hypothesis is different:

- boxplots H0: the two populations are different.
- CSV statistics file: the contacts' count the group 1 distribution is greater than the one of the group 2.
